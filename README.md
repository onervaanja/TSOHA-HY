# Application description:

# (insert name) is a data base application of which purpose is to be a foundation for its users to share ratings and opinions of trip destinations. The application qualities include:

# 1. The front page (features a selection of recently and frequently rated destinations)
# 2. A log-in / registration page
# 3. The ability to search for destinations alphabetically and / or by name
# 4. The ability to give out ratings to either already existing or new destinations while logged in (May be added later: new destinations need to be accepted by administration)
# 5. A page for each destination which shows the destination's overall rating and popularity based on users' reviews.

# The scope of this program is limited around the idea of having a statistical rating system instead of qualitative descriptions, which makes it easy for visitors to find reliable knowledge of trip destinations by a standard set of variables, such as price range, LGBTQ-friendliness, weather, accessibility, safety, cultural attractions and variety of restaurants suitable for special diets.

# Development plan:

# 1. (Additional, not planned but executed) Procrastinating the actual programming part and playing around with html and the front page structure
# 2. ???
